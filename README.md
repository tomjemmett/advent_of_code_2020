# Advent of Code 2020

This is my attempt to complete the [Advent of Code 2020][aoc2020] in R using RMarkdown, along with bookdown to render
the site. The book will automatically be rebuilt using [GitHub actions][ghactions] and hosted using
[GitHub Pages][ghpages].

You can view the output on [tomjemmett.github.io/advent_of_code_2020/][output]
